Tivoka
======

A leightweight JSON-RPC client and server implementation for PHP.
Copyright (C) 2011  Marcel Klehr


The Goal
--------
JSON-RPC is the alternative for complicated data type handling and an unintuitive
data structure in XML-RPC. Since JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) natively
supports string, integer, float and array data types it's much more suitable
for a remote procedure protocol. The product of this idea is JSON-RPC.
The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use and specification compatible
JSON-RPC implementation for PHP.
(This version is based on the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification proposal.)

How it works
------------
With Tivoka, you can easily set up a server, which can either simply port all the
methods of a given PHP object or provide access to a specific list of various PHP callbacks.
Performing a JSON-RPC request isn’t difficult either: Just give the URL of the server,
send a request, a notification or even a batch and get the result immediately.

Using Tivoka
------------
If you are about to use Tivoka in your project you will simply have toinclude 'include.php'
in the 'tivoka' directory.
Check out the 'sample/' directory and explore the samples for a quick introduction
how to use Tivoka.
